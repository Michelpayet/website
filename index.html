                    <h2>Gym</h2>
                    <p>I've been working out since I was nearly 16, and throughout this journey, 
                        I've gained valuable knowledge while growing both physically and mentally. 
                        I’ve come to see bodybuilding as an art form, sculpting my body with 
                        dedication and precision. My passion led me to compete in Men's Physique, 
                        where I proudly secured 2nd place. Even though I’ve since transitioned to 
                        a career in IT, I still enjoy training, though not with the same dedication as before.</p>

                    <h2>Art</h2>
                    <p>I've been drawing for as long as I can remember, and over time, 
                        I've improved significantly. Eventually, I ventured into painting 
                        and was pleasantly surprised by how naturally it came to me. 
                        For me, art has always been a form of therapy.</p>

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>Music is deeply rooted in my family. My mum is a singer, 
                        and I grew up in a household where the radio was always on. 
                        Sundays were dedicated to the best hits from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, 
                        with a special focus on the 80s. From a young age, I had a strong 
                        desire to play an instrument, and the guitar quickly became my favorite. 
                        In 2010, I was introduced to FL Studio, which taught me a great deal 
                        about music production. Occasionally, I return to it to create music 
                        for its therapeutic benefits.

                    <h2>Coding</h2>
                    <p>I love coding, especially front-end web development, because it lets me express my creativity 
                        in a highly visual way. I enjoy the challenge of transforming ideas into interactive, 
                        aesthetically pleasing websites that users can engage with. The combination of design and 
                        functionality excites me, as I get to experiment with layouts, colors, and animations, 
                        all while ensuring a smooth user experience. Front-end development allows me to bring concepts to life, 
                        making the creative process both dynamic and rewarding.

                    <p>I love studying and earning new certifications in IT because it allows me to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving field, 
                        constantly learning new technologies and skills. The challenge of mastering complex concepts and solving problems 
                        keeps me engaged, while certifications provide a tangible sense of accomplishment and credibility. 
                        It also opens doors to new career opportunities, enabling me to grow professionally and remain competitive in the industry. Overall, 
                        it fuels my passion for continuous learning and personal growth in an exciting and dynamic space.

                        By preparing these dishes myself, I can truly appreciate and enjoy the diversity of other cultures. 
                        Cooking gives me the freedom to experiment, learn, and connect with global traditions in a hands-on and personal way, making it both fun and rewarding.
